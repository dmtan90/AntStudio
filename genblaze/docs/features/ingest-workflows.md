# Ingest workflows

genblaze's pipeline surface is generation-shaped by default — you compose
:class:`Pipeline` from `.step(provider=…)` calls that produce new content.
But many real workflows are **non-generative**: live ingest, user-uploaded
content, archival imports, DAM bulk loads, podcast hosting, cross-tenancy
migrations. The bytes already exist; the SDK's job is to record provenance
for the act of bringing them in.

`Pipeline.ingest()` is the entry point. Each ingested asset becomes a
:class:`Step` with `step_type=StepType.INGEST` (or `StepType.IMPORT`),
`provider=None`, and `model=` set to the source identifier you supply
(`"rss"`, `"ugc-upload"`, `"dam-bulk"`, etc.). The resulting manifest
documents who, what, when, and from where, with the same canonical-hash
discipline as a generative run.

## Quickstart

```python
from genblaze_core import (
    Asset, KeyStrategy, ObjectStorageSink, Pipeline,
)
from genblaze_s3 import S3StorageBackend

# Storage sink (CONTENT_ADDRESSABLE recommended for ingest — dedupes
# duplicate uploads automatically by SHA-256).
backend = S3StorageBackend.for_backblaze(
    "my-bucket", auto_lifecycle=True,
)
sink = ObjectStorageSink(
    backend,
    prefix="ingest",
    key_strategy=KeyStrategy.CONTENT_ADDRESSABLE,
)

# A list of assets to ingest. URLs may be `https://` (downloaded with
# SSRF protection) or `file://` (allowlisted local paths only).
assets = [
    Asset(url="https://feed.example.com/ep1.mp3", media_type="audio/mp3"),
    Asset(url="https://feed.example.com/ep2.mp3", media_type="audio/mp3"),
]

result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=assets,
    source="rss",
    source_metadata={"feed_url": "https://example.com/podcast.xml"},
    sink=sink,
    name="weekly-podcast-import",
)

# After ingest:
# - Each asset's URL is now the durable backend URL
# - sha256 / size_bytes are populated
# - The manifest documents the import event
# - sink has a sidecar index for reverse lookup
print(f"Imported {len(result.run.steps)} assets")
print(f"Manifest hash: {result.manifest.canonical_hash}")
```

## Use cases

### Podcast hosting (RSS pull → store → manifest)

A podcast app polls an RSS feed, finds new episodes, and ingests them.
`Pipeline.ingest` records each episode's source URL, ingest timestamp,
and content hash. Later transcription / transcoding runs chain on top
via `input_from=` referencing the ingest step indices.

```python
result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=[Asset(url=episode.enclosure_url, media_type="audio/mp3")
            for episode in feed_entries],
    source="rss",
    source_metadata={"feed_url": feed.url, "show_title": feed.title},
    sink=podcast_sink,
)
```

### UGC upload (user file → moderation → manifest)

A web app accepts a file from a user, persists it durably, and records
who uploaded it. Moderation can run before or after the ingest step
via :class:`ModerationHook`.

```python
asset = Asset(url=f"file://{tmp_path}", media_type="image/jpeg")

# Ingest first — gets the asset durable + hashed.
result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=[asset],
    source="ugc-upload",
    source_metadata={
        "uploader_id": current_user.id,
        "session_id": session.id,
        "ip": request.remote_addr,
    },
    sink=ugc_sink,
)

# Moderation runs against the (now-persistable) asset.
moderation_result = my_moderation_hook.check_output([asset])
```

### Archival / DAM bulk import

A digital-asset-management migration moves thousands of files from a
legacy system into B2. The CONTENT_ADDRESSABLE strategy automatically
dedupes — identical files across the source dataset land at the same
hash key.

```python
assets = [
    Asset(url=f"file://{path}", media_type=mime)
    for path, mime in legacy_inventory
]
result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=assets,
    source="dam-bulk",
    source_metadata={"source_system": "legacy-cms", "migration_id": run_id},
    sink=dam_sink,
)
```

### Cross-system / cross-tenant transfers

Use `step_type=StepType.IMPORT` (vs the default `INGEST`) when bringing
assets across system / tenant boundaries — semantically distinct from a
fresh external pull.

```python
result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=cross_tenant_assets,
    source="cross-tenancy",
    source_metadata={"src_tenant": "acme", "dst_tenant": "acme-eu"},
    sink=eu_sink,
    step_type=StepType.IMPORT,
)
```

### Live ingest (RTMP / segment-by-segment)

`Pipeline.ingest` handles a batch per call. For live streams, batch a
window of segments per call and chain calls in your producer loop. The
SDK doesn't ship a stream-aware daemon — recipe-level only.

```python
async def ingest_loop(stream):
    while True:
        window = await stream.next_window(seconds=10)
        Pipeline.ingest(
            assets=[Asset(url=seg.url, media_type="video/mp4") for seg in window],
            source="rtmp-live",
            source_metadata={"stream_id": stream.id, "window_start": window.start},
            sink=live_sink,
        )
```

## Reverse lookup: from `asset_id` back to the manifest

When an `Asset` flows through your system in isolation (e.g. you've
serialized just the asset_id to a row in your job queue), you can
recover the manifest that introduced it:

```python
manifest = sink.read_manifest_for_asset(asset.asset_id, tenant_id="tenant-a")
if manifest is not None:
    print(f"Asset {asset.asset_id} ingested in run {manifest.run.run_id}")
    print(f"Source: {manifest.run.steps[0].metadata['source']}")
```

The reverse lookup works because `Pipeline.ingest(..., tenant_id=...)` calls
`sink.put_asset(asset, manifest_uri=..., tenant_id=...)` for every asset, and
`ObjectStorageSink.put_asset` writes a tenant-scoped sidecar index entry at
`{prefix}/_index/{tenant_id}/{asset_id}.json` mapping each asset to its
manifest URI.

Reverse lookup is an authorization boundary. Callers must pass the tenant (or
equivalent caller context), the asset ID must be a UUID, the recovered manifest
must verify, the manifest tenant must match, and the manifest must actually
reference the requested asset ID before it is returned. During the migration
from the legacy flat index, a miss on the tenant-scoped key falls back to
`{prefix}/_index/{asset_id}.json` and backfills the scoped key after those
checks pass.

Assets *not* persisted via `Pipeline.ingest` (or via direct
`sink.put_asset(asset, manifest_uri=..., tenant_id=...)` with an explicit
manifest_uri and tenant) are not discoverable via this path — by design. The
index is opt-in and tenant-scoped.

## Manifest determinism

`Pipeline.ingest` sorts the finished steps by content — not `asset_id` — using
the same fields that feed the manifest hash (`sha256`, `media_type`,
`size_bytes`, dimensions, ...; see `asset_provenance_key` in
`genblaze_core.models.manifest`). `asset_id` defaults to a random UUID and is
excluded from the hash payload (schema 1.4+), so sorting by it would reshuffle
same-content batches on every call. The sort runs *after* `sink.put_asset` has
populated each asset's `sha256` / `size_bytes` — sorting before the sink runs
would tie on the placeholder content every fresh batch shares (no hash yet)
and silently fall back to caller input order, reintroducing the same
non-determinism one layer deeper. Sorting by real content after the sink
writes means the resulting manifest's `canonical_hash` is **invariant under
permuted input order, and even across fresh `Asset` instances with new random
ids** — calling `ingest(assets=[a, b, c])` and `ingest(assets=[c, a, b])` with
the same asset content produces a byte-identical manifest hash (modulo
`Run.name` and a few other deliberately-included caller-provenance fields):

```python
import itertools
hashes = set()
for permutation in itertools.permutations(assets):
    r = Pipeline.ingest(assets=list(permutation), source="t", name="ingest-test")
    hashes.add(r.manifest.canonical_hash)
assert len(hashes) == 1  # invariant holds across all 6 permutations
```

This matters for reproducibility: a DAM bulk-import that retries with a
different scan order — or rebuilds fresh `Asset` objects for the same
underlying files — still produces the same provenance fingerprint.

## INGEST vs IMPORT

| Step type | Use when |
|---|---|
| `StepType.INGEST` (default) | External-source pull. RSS feed, UGC upload, web crawl, RTMP live capture. Bytes are arriving from outside the system for the first time. |
| `StepType.IMPORT` | Cross-system or cross-tenancy transfer. The bytes already lived in some genblaze-managed system; you're moving them to a new context. |

Both step types may have `provider=None` — the validator on :class:`Step`
permits null provider only for these two types. Every other step type
(GENERATE / UPSCALE / TRANSCODE / etc.) continues to require a provider
because there's an upstream service to attribute.

## Differences from the generative `Pipeline.step()` builder

The generation pipeline is fluent and order-sensitive:

```python
result = (
    Pipeline("generate-video")
    .step(provider=…, model=…, prompt=…)         # step 0
    .step(provider=…, input_from=[0], …)         # step 1 chains on step 0
    .run()
)
```

`Pipeline.ingest` is **factory-style** — one call, all assets, no
chaining within the ingest itself:

```python
result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=[…],          # parallel — order doesn't affect manifest
    source="rss",
    sink=sink,
)
# Subsequent generative work (transcribe, classify, transform) is its own
# Pipeline instance that references the ingested assets via input_from=.
```

The two surfaces compose: ingest the assets via `Pipeline.ingest`, then
run a generative `Pipeline.step()` that consumes them as inputs.

## Composing ingest with later generation

Once assets are durable in your sink, downstream generation references
them by URL or by asset_id:

```python
# Step 1: ingest podcasts
ingest_result = Pipeline.ingest(
    assets=[Asset(url=ep.url, media_type="audio/mp3") for ep in episodes],
    source="rss",
    sink=sink,
)

# Step 2: transcribe via Whisper (chains in once Wave 6 ships)
# transcribed = (
#     Pipeline("transcribe-batch")
#     .step(WhisperProvider(), input_from=[*range(len(ingest_result.run.steps))], …)
#     .run(sink=sink)
# )
```
