# Streaming

Push-style event iterators over pipeline execution. Use for progress UIs, dashboards, or feeding an agent loop.

`StreamEvent` is a Pydantic discriminated union: every variant is its own subclass with only the fields that variant actually carries. Branching on `event.type` — or `isinstance(event, StepFailedEvent)` — narrows correctly under pyright / mypy and in IDE autocomplete.

## Quickstart

```python
from genblaze_core import Pipeline
from genblaze_openai import DalleProvider

pipe = Pipeline("hero").step(DalleProvider(), model="dall-e-3", prompt="a sunset", modality="image")

for event in pipe.stream():
    match event.type:
        case "step.progress":
            print(f"{event.progress_pct:.0%} {event.preview_url or ''}")
        case "step.completed":
            print(f"✓ {event.step.provider}/{event.step.model}")
        case "step.failed":
            print(f"✗ {event.step_id}: {event.error}")
        case "pipeline.completed":
            print(f"Done — hash {event.result.manifest.canonical_hash[:12]}")
```

Async:

```python
async for event in pipe.astream():
    ...
```

## Event types

Every variant carries `type` and `timestamp`. Variant-specific required/optional fields are below (all 10 variants live in `genblaze_core.observability.events`).

| Type | Class | Required fields | Other fields |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| `pipeline.started` | `PipelineStartedEvent` | `run_id`, `total_steps` | `message` (pipeline name) |
| `step.queued` | `StepQueuedEvent` | `run_id`, `step_id`, `step_index`, `total_steps`, `provider`, `model`, `reason` | — |
| `step.started` | `StepStartedEvent` | `run_id`, `step_id`, `step_index`, `total_steps`, `provider`, `model` | `expected_duration_sec` |
| `step.progress` | `StepProgressEvent` | `step_id`, `provider`, `model` | `run_id`, `request_id`, `progress_pct`, `preview_url`, `elapsed_sec`, `message`, `data` |
| `step.retried` | `StepRetriedEvent` | `step_id`, `provider`, `model`, `phase`, `attempt`, `max_attempts`, `delay_sec` | `run_id`, `error_code`, `error` |
| `step.completed` | `StepCompletedEvent` | `step_id`, `step_index`, `total_steps`, `provider`, `model`, `elapsed_sec` | `run_id`, `request_id`, `step_status`, `step` (in-process `Step`) |
| `step.failed` | `StepFailedEvent` | `step_id`, `step_index`, `total_steps`, `provider`, `model`, `elapsed_sec` | `run_id`, `request_id`, `error`, `step_status`, `step` (in-process `Step`) |
| `pipeline.completed` | `PipelineCompletedEvent` | `run_id` | `run_status`, `manifest_hash`, `result` (in-process `PipelineResult`) |
| `pipeline.failed` | `PipelineFailedEvent` | `run_id` | `message`, `run_status`, `manifest_hash`, `result` |
| `agent.iteration.started` | `AgentIterationStartedEvent` | `iteration`, `total` | `message` (prior feedback) |
| `agent.iteration.evaluated` | `AgentIterationEvaluatedEvent` | `iteration`, `passed` | `score`, `feedback`, `result` |
| `agent.completed` | `AgentCompletedEvent` | `passed`, `iterations` | `total_cost_usd`, `result` |

Notes:

- **`step` / `result` are in-process only** — present on the Python object, excluded from JSON serialization. Wire consumers read the derived `step_status` / `manifest_hash` / `run_status` / `error` fields.
- **`step.failed` carries `error`, not `message`.** The legacy dataclass emitted both keys with the same string for failure events; the discriminated union keeps only `error`. Webhook / SSE / log consumers that key on `message` for failures should switch.
- **Agent events expose flat fields.** `event.iteration` / `event.score` / `event.passed`, not `event.data["iteration"]` etc.
- Not every variant has `run_id` — agent-loop events don't (they're pipeline-independent). Every pipeline-scoped variant, including `step.completed` / `step.failed`, carries the enclosing run's `run_id`.

## ETA hint (`expected_duration_sec`)

`Pipeline.step(expected_duration_sec=...)` echoes a caller-supplied ETA onto the matching `step.started` event so consumers can render a meaningful progress UI without hard-coding per-model knowledge:

```python
pipe = (
    Pipeline("hero")
    .step(provider, model="veo-3", prompt="a sunset", expected_duration_sec=180)
)

for ev in pipe.stream():
    if ev.type == "step.started":
        eta = ev.expected_duration_sec  # 180.0
    elif ev.type == "step.progress" and eta:
        bar = min(ev.elapsed_sec / eta, 0.99)  # clamp; never claim 100% while polling
        print(f"≈ {bar:.0%}")
```

The SDK does **not** synthesize `expected_duration_sec` — supply your own median (or p50) from observed runs. Stale or wrong values produce worse UX than omitting the field, so the field is opt-in per call rather than baked into provider registries.

## Upstream `request_id`

`step.progress`, `step.completed`, and `step.failed` carry an optional `request_id` — the upstream provider's prediction/job id (e.g. Replicate prediction id, Runway task id). Populated as soon as `submit()` returns; pre-submit progress ticks carry `null`.

```python
for ev in pipe.stream():
    if ev.type == "step.progress" and ev.request_id:
        print(f"Live: https://replicate.com/p/{ev.request_id}")
```

The same id is also persisted at `step.metadata["upstream_id"]` for in-process consumers.

## Queued steps ("Up next")

`step.queued` fires for steps that are waiting on capacity:

- **Sequential pipeline** — every step except the first emits `step.queued(reason="serial")` at run start, so a UI can render the full execution plan before the first step actually begins.
- **Concurrent pipeline with `max_concurrency`** — a coroutine that finds the semaphore locked emits `step.queued(reason="concurrency_limit")` before it acquires.

The event is purely additive: `step.started` keeps firing where it always has. Consumers that don't render an "Up next" tray can ignore the event type.

```python
for ev in pipe.stream():
    if ev.type == "step.queued":
        ui.add_pending(ev.step_id, ev.provider, ev.model, reason=ev.reason)
    elif ev.type == "step.started":
        ui.move_to_running(ev.step_id)  # same step_id as the prior queued event
```

`step_id` matches between a step's `step.queued` and its later `step.started` / `step.completed` events. Cancelled-while-queued steps (fail-fast on a sibling) won't see a terminal event of their own — `pipeline.failed` is the terminal for any still-queued step.

## Heartbeats on long polls

When a provider's poll interval grows past 15s (Sora, Veo, Stable Audio long-form), `BaseProvider` splits the sleep into 10s chunks and emits a `step.progress` event with `is_heartbeat=True` between chunks. Keeps SSE proxies, load balancers, and impatient users from seeing a dead connection.

```python
for ev in pipe.stream():
    if ev.type == "step.progress":
        if ev.is_heartbeat:
            keepalive_ping()  # connection alive — no new payload
        else:
            update_ui(ev)
```

For high-volume deployments where the keepalive overhead outweighs the benefit, drop heartbeats at the emitter:

```python
for ev in pipe.stream(heartbeats=False):  # is_heartbeat=True events filtered
    ...
```

## Preview URLs

Providers that expose in-progress artifacts (Runway intermediate frames, Luma draft stills, waveform thumbnails) populate `StepProgressEvent.preview_url` via the `poll_progress()` hook on `BaseProvider`. Consumers receive them automatically — no consumer-side wiring required.

### Connector-author contract

Override `poll_progress(prediction_id)` to return a dict with any of:

| Key | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `preview_url` | `str` | Re-validated against the SSRF allowlist before forwarding. |
| `progress_pct` | `float` | Must be in `[0.0, 1.0]`. |
| `message` | `str` | Human-readable status. |

Return `None` when no signals are available. The base poll loop calls `poll_progress` once per poll iteration and merges the result into the next `step.progress` event — no double API call as long as you cache the in-progress payload during `poll()`:

```python
def poll(self, prediction_id, config=None) -> bool:
    job = self._client.tasks.get(prediction_id)
    if job.status in ("done", "failed"):
        self._cache_poll_result(prediction_id, job)
        return True
    self._progress_cache[str(prediction_id)] = job  # for poll_progress
    return False

def poll_progress(self, prediction_id):
    job = self._progress_cache.get(str(prediction_id))
    if job is None:
        return None
    return {
        "progress_pct": getattr(job, "progress", None),
        "preview_url": getattr(job, "thumbnail_url", None),
    }
```

## Relationship to legacy callbacks

`on_progress` and `on_step_complete` still work exactly as before. `stream()` layers on top — it wraps the existing callback wiring with a queue. You can combine both:

```python
def log_progress(ev):
    print(f"[log] {ev.provider} {ev.progress_pct}")

for event in pipe.stream(on_progress=log_progress):  # both fire
    ...
```

## Error handling

If the pipeline raises an uncaught exception (not captured as a step failure) — including a `pipeline_timeout` expiring before any step even started — `stream()`/`astream()` still emit a terminal `pipeline.failed` event (never `pipeline.completed`) before draining and re-raising the exception. Wrap iteration in a try/except to surface it:

```python
try:
    for event in pipe.stream(pipeline_timeout=30):
        ...
except PipelineTimeoutError:
    ...  # pipeline.failed was already observed on the stream before this raises
```

## Early break

Breaking out of iteration before the terminal event (`pipeline.completed` / `pipeline.failed`) is safe and non-blocking. Control returns to the caller immediately. Consequences:

- **Sync `stream()`**: the worker thread keeps running in the background until the pipeline naturally completes, but the emitter is closed as soon as the break is detected, so its remaining events become no-ops instead of piling onto a queue nobody drains (see Buffering below).
- **Async `astream()`**: the worker task is cancelled at its next `await` point, unwinding in-flight provider calls; the emitter is likewise closed first so anything racing the cancellation is dropped.
- Any post-break exception in the pipeline is suppressed.
- Asset generation, sink writes, and tracer callbacks still run to completion for whatever work was already in flight — breaking out of the stream does **not** roll back partial work.

To actually cancel pending work, use `astream()` (which cancels the worker task; in-flight `asyncio` awaits raise `CancelledError`) or kill the surrounding process. There is no way to interrupt a sync `run()` mid-flight.

## Buffering / backpressure

Event queues have no `maxsize`, but growth is bounded to the in-flight window: on early break, the emitter closes immediately, so an abandoned worker's remaining `put()` calls become silent no-ops instead of buffering events for the rest of the run. A fully-drained stream (consumer keeps iterating to the terminal event) still only accumulates events while the consumer is momentarily behind the producer — in practice a few KB even for long video runs, since providers poll at 1–30s intervals. No backpressure is applied to providers; if you need to throttle work, use `max_concurrency` on the pipeline rather than slowing the stream consumer.

## Concurrent stream()/astream() calls

Calling `stream()`/`astream()` more than once on the **same** `Pipeline` or `AgentLoop` instance — e.g., two concurrent web requests reusing a shared, preconfigured object — is supported and isolated. Each call installs its emitter on a thread/task-local slot (`contextvars.ContextVar`-backed), so events from one call's worker never cross-deliver into another call's queue, and each stream's terminal event always reflects its own run. There is no shared mutable state to lock around.

## Nested / composed pipelines inside a stream() worker

The emitter slot is built fresh **per `Pipeline`/`AgentLoop` instance** (in `__init__`), not shared across instances. A DIFFERENT pipeline instance run synchronously inside `outer.stream()`'s worker — e.g. a step provider, moderation hook, or callback that constructs and runs its own `inner_pipeline.run()`, or a nested `batch_run()`/`abatch_run()` — never observes `outer`'s emitter and stays silent on `outer`'s queue (#151). This is distinct from `AgentLoop`'s intentional composition: `AgentLoop._build_pipeline()` explicitly calls `pipeline.attach_emitter(...)` to pipe each iteration's pipeline events into the loop's own stream — that's an opt-in wiring, not implicit sharing. `batch_run()`/`abatch_run()` clones (`copy.copy(self)`) likewise never share the emitter slot with the pipeline that spawned them, even though they DO share the WARN-dedup preflight lock/set.

## Narrowing with `isinstance`

Each variant is importable from `genblaze_core.observability`. `isinstance(ev, StepFailedEvent)` narrows to that class with its required fields; type checkers catch invalid access at lint time.

```python
from genblaze_core.observability import (
    StepFailedEvent, PipelineCompletedEvent, StreamEvent,
)

for ev in pipe.stream():
    if isinstance(ev, StepFailedEvent):
        log.error("step %s failed: %s", ev.step_id, ev.error)
    elif isinstance(ev, PipelineCompletedEvent):
        publish_manifest(ev.manifest_hash, ev.run_status)
```

`isinstance(ev, StreamEvent)` remains truthy for any variant — useful in plumbing code that treats events uniformly.

## Wire format + TypeScript consumers

`event.to_dict()` is a JSON-safe serialization: `type` + `timestamp` + the variant's declared fields, with in-process `step` / `result` excluded. Under the hood it's `model_dump(mode="json", exclude_none=True)`.

For external parsers:

```python
from genblaze_core.observability import StreamEventAdapter

# Parse an inbound event dict into the correct variant via the `type` discriminator
event = StreamEventAdapter.validate_python(some_json_dict)  # returns StepFailedEvent, etc.
```

TypeScript / Node consumers should pull generated types from `libs/spec/ts/genblaze.d.ts` (or the future `@genblaze/spec` npm package). The same discriminator narrows in TypeScript:

```ts
import type { StreamEvent } from "@genblaze/spec";

function render(ev: StreamEvent) {
  if (ev.type === "step.failed") {
    // ev.error, ev.step_id — fully typed
  }
}
```

The authoritative JSON Schemas live at `libs/spec/schemas/events/v1/` (one per variant + a parent `stream-event.schema.json` with `oneOf` + `discriminator`). `test_spec_conformance.py` enforces Pydantic ↔ schema parity on every `make test`.

## Internals

- `stream()` runs `run()` in a worker thread, yielding from `queue.Queue`.
- `astream()` runs `arun()` as an `asyncio.Task`, yielding from `asyncio.Queue`.
- The active emitter is held in an `EmitterSlot` (`libs/core/genblaze_core/pipeline/streaming.py`) — a `contextvars.ContextVar`-backed slot, not a plain instance attribute. Each `Pipeline`/`AgentLoop` **instance** builds its own `EmitterSlot` in `__init__` (not a class-level singleton — see #151), and each worker thread/task installs its own emitter there. The sync `stream()` worker runs via `contextvars.copy_context().run(...)` inside its `threading.Thread` (mirroring the isolation `asyncio.create_task()` already gets for free), so the install is scoped to that one throwaway `Context` rather than the OS thread itself — correct even if a future caller reuses worker threads via a pooled executor instead of spawning one per call. `Pipeline.__copy__`/`__getstate__`/`__setstate__` always give a clone a brand-new `EmitterSlot`, never a shared one — unlike the WARN-dedup preflight lock/set, which `batch_run()`/`abatch_run()` clones intentionally share.
