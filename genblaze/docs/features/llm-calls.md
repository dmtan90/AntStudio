# Feature: LLM Calls

Thin standalone wrappers around OpenAI, Google Gemini, and GMICloud chat /
completion APIs. Returns a uniform `ChatResponse` so callers can swap
providers without rewriting response handling.

**Not** integrated with `Pipeline` / `Step` / `Asset` / manifest. Genblaze
is a media-generation framework; chat is a convenience for callers that
want to drive media steps from an LLM without taking a second LLM-routing
dependency. If you need manifest provenance for an LLM call, stash details
in `step.metadata` on the downstream media step, or wrap the call in your
own `SyncProvider` subclass (recipe below).

`Pipeline.step()` requires a `BaseProvider` instance and raises `TypeError`
immediately if you pass `chat`/`achat` directly — they're plain functions,
not providers, so there's nothing for `Pipeline.run()` to call `invoke()` on.

## Recording a chat step's provenance

To make a script-writing `chat()` call appear as a step in the manifest
(so provenance covers the words as well as the downstream media), wrap it
in a small local `SyncProvider`:

```python
import hashlib

from genblaze_core import Asset, Pipeline, SyncProvider
from genblaze_openai import chat

class ChatStep(SyncProvider):
    name = "openai-chat"

    def generate(self, step, config=None):
        resp = chat(step.model, prompt=step.prompt)
        digest = hashlib.sha256(resp.text.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
        # metadata["text"] is what Pipeline's own moderation code reads
        # (_input_text_payloads) for textual assets. url="text:<sha256>" is
        # just a stable, content-addressed identifier for provenance — it
        # is never fetched, so it's fine that it isn't https/file (an
        # inline data: URI would work too, but has undefined sink behavior).
        step.assets.append(
            Asset(url=f"text:{digest}", media_type="text/plain", sha256=digest,
                  metadata={"text": resp.text})
        )
        return step

# Run the chat step on its own — input_from=[...] chaining fetches
# step.inputs by URL (https/file only, enforced for SSRF safety by
# validate_chain_input_url) and can't be used to hand raw text to the
# next step. Instead, read the text back out of the completed step and
# pass it as a normal prompt= to the next pipeline.
chat_result = (
    Pipeline("narration-script")
    .step(ChatStep(), model="gpt-4o", prompt="Write a one-line narration")
    .run()
)
script = chat_result.run.steps[0].assets[0].metadata["text"]

tts_result = (
    Pipeline("narration-audio")
    .from_result(chat_result)  # links parent_run_id for provenance lineage
    .step(TtsProvider(), model="tts-1", prompt=script)
    .run()
)
```

`ChatStep` only needs `generate()` — `SyncProvider` handles the rest of the
submit/poll/fetch_output lifecycle. `Pipeline.from_result()` links the two
runs via `parent_run_id` so the manifest for the audio step points back at
the run that produced its script. This is a documentation recipe, not a
built-in class; there is no first-party text/chat `BaseProvider` today (see
`docs/exec-plans/active/multimodal-chat-provider.md`).

## Surface

- `genblaze_openai.chat`, `genblaze_openai.achat`
- `genblaze_google.chat`, `genblaze_google.achat`
- `genblaze_gmicloud.chat`, `genblaze_gmicloud.achat`
- Models: `genblaze_core.models.chat.{ChatMessage, ToolCall, ChatResponse}`

## Signature

```python
chat(
    model: str,
    messages: list[ChatMessage] | list[dict] | None = None,
    *,
    prompt: str | None = None,
    system: str | None = None,
    tools: list[dict] | None = None,
    temperature: float | None = None,
    max_tokens: int | None = None,
    api_key: str | None = None,
    client: Any = None,        # escape hatch
    retry_on_rate_limit: bool = False,   # openai / google only — see "Rate limits" below
    retry_policy: RetryPolicy | None = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> ChatResponse
```

`ChatResponse` carries `text`, `model`, `finish_reason`, `tokens_in/out`,
`tokens_cached`, `tool_calls`, `cost_usd`, `raw`.

## Usage

```python
from genblaze_openai import chat

resp = chat("gpt-4o", prompt="A cinematic sunset over Tokyo")
# resp.text, resp.tokens_out, resp.cost_usd
```

Compose with a media step manually:

```python
description = chat("gpt-4o", prompt="A cinematic sunset").text
pipe = Pipeline("hero").step(SoraProvider(), model="sora-2", prompt=description)
```

## Rate limits

**These helpers do not retry by default.** A 429 raises immediately — the
`ProviderError` carries a parsed `retry_after` hint (seconds), but callers
must act on it themselves. At archive scale (e.g. many vision calls over
video frames) this is the common case, not an edge case.

For `genblaze_openai.chat`/`achat` and `genblaze_google.chat`/`achat`, pass
`retry_on_rate_limit=True` to opt in to a bounded wait-and-retry loop that
honors the server's `Retry-After` hint (falling back to exponential backoff
with jitter when no hint is present):

```python
from genblaze_openai import chat

# Retries up to RetryPolicy()'s default 6 attempts, honoring each 429's
# `Retry-After` hint before raising.
resp = chat("gpt-4o-mini", messages=frame_messages, retry_on_rate_limit=True)
```

Pass a `genblaze_core.providers.retry.RetryPolicy` via `retry_policy=` to tune
the attempt cap or backoff timing (passing `retry_policy=` alone, without
`retry_on_rate_limit=True`, also opts in). `retry_policy.retryable_codes` can
only *narrow* retry here — e.g. `RetryPolicy.disabled()` turns retry off
entirely — it cannot broaden retry to other error codes; this loop only ever
acts on `RATE_LIMIT`, by design, regardless of what `retryable_codes` contains.

When `chat()` creates its own client (no `client=` passed) and retry is
opted in, the OpenAI/Gemini SDK's own internal retry is disabled
(`max_retries=0` / a single-attempt `HttpRetryOptions`) so `RetryPolicy.max_attempts`
is the only retry budget in effect — otherwise the SDK would retry underneath
this loop and multiply the effective attempt count. If you pass your own
`client=`, its retry configuration is untouched; configure it yourself to match.

**Known limits of this opt-in loop:**

- **Bounded but not tiny.** Worst case here is `(max_attempts - 1) *
  MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SEC`, *plus* each attempt's own HTTP `timeout=` — with the
  default policy (6 attempts, 120s cap) that's up to ~10 minutes from backoff
  alone, and higher still if attempts themselves stall close to `timeout=`
  before failing. Pass a tighter `retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=2)`
  and/or a smaller `timeout=` if that ceiling is unacceptable for your call site.
- **`achat()` occupies a thread-pool worker for the whole wait.** `asyncio.to_thread`
  runs on Python's shared default `ThreadPoolExecutor` (capped around
  `min(32, os.cpu_count() + 4)` workers, process-wide). A retrying
  `achat(retry_on_rate_limit=True)` call holds its worker — sleeping, not just
  computing — for as long as the loop above, so a burst of concurrent retrying
  calls can exhaust that pool and stall unrelated `to_thread` work elsewhere in
  the process. Bound how many `achat()` calls run concurrently (e.g. an
  `asyncio.Semaphore`) rather than firing an unbounded number at once.
- **Not a rate limiter.** This is a per-call retry wrapper, not a shared
  token-bucket / queue-level limiter. Many concurrent callers hitting the same
  TPM ceiling all see the same server `Retry-After` hint and wake in lockstep,
  which can immediately re-trip the limit. For sustained, high-concurrency
  archive runs, pace calls externally (e.g. a semaphore or a queue) in addition
  to (not instead of) `retry_on_rate_limit=True`.

## Limits (v1)

- No token streaming. Use the provider SDK directly if you need it.
- No cross-provider tool-definition normalization — `tools=` passes through
  to the provider's native shape.
- Multi-turn tool conversations against Gemini require dict messages in
  Gemini's native shape; canonical `ChatMessage.tool_calls` translation is
  outbound-text-only.
- Gemini's `system=` kwarg, when set, supersedes any system message in the
  `messages` list. OpenAI / GMICloud keep both (provider behavior).
- `cost_usd` is always `None` for all standalone `chat()` helpers
  (OpenAI, Gemini, GMICloud). Vendor prices drift too fast for static
  tables to stay accurate, and `chat()` has no model registry. Compute
  cost from `tokens_in`/`tokens_out` using your own rates (see
  `docs/reference/pricing-recipes.md`). `PricingContext` populates cost
  only on the Pipeline-Step provider path, not here.
- Model ids pass through verbatim — unknown models aren't blocked
  client-side. Matches the "unknown models pass through" convention used
  by the media provider classes.
- Errors are wrapped in `ProviderError` with a classified `error_code`.
