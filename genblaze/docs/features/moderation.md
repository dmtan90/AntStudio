# Moderation Hooks

`ModerationHook` provides pre/post-step content screening for prompt text,
manifest-visible input text, and generated outputs.

## Usage

```python
from genblaze_core import Pipeline, ModerationHook, ModerationResult, Modality

class MyModerationHook(ModerationHook):
    def check_prompt(self, prompt, params):
        if "forbidden" in (prompt or ""):
            return ModerationResult(
                allowed=False, reason="Forbidden content",
                flagged_categories=["policy"],
            )
        return ModerationResult(allowed=True)

    def check_output(self, assets):
        return ModerationResult(allowed=True)

result = (
    Pipeline("moderated", moderation=MyModerationHook())
    .step(provider, model="m", prompt="hello", modality=Modality.IMAGE)
    .run()
)
```

## Execution order

1. **Pre-step moderation** — `check_prompt()` before generation. Rejected prompts or recognized textual inputs skip the provider entirely.
2. **Cache lookup** — only reached if moderation passes.
3. **Provider invoke** — with fallback model support.
4. **Post-step moderation** — `check_output()` after generation. Rejected outputs are not cached.
5. **Cache write** — only for SUCCEEDED steps.

## Pre-step coverage

Pre-step moderation runs after pipeline inputs are resolved and before cache lookup or provider invocation. The payload passed to `check_prompt(prompt, params)` includes:

- `Step.prompt` and `Step.negative_prompt` when they are not `None`
- text found in `Asset.metadata["text"]` on `Step.inputs`, including inputs from `external_inputs=`, `input_from=`, and `chain=True`; strings are used as-is, bytes are decoded as UTF-8 with replacement, and structured values are JSON-stringified

When prompts and textual inputs are present, they are joined with blank lines and checked once. Promptless steps with textual inputs are moderated. Promptless steps with no textual inputs, such as compositors or transforms that only consume media URLs, still skip pre-step moderation.

### Security scope

Pre-step moderation does **not** fetch or read `Asset.url`, even for
`text/plain` assets, and it does not scan arbitrary metadata keys such as
`caption`, `alt`, or provider-specific payload fields. Those channels remain the
responsibility of the caller or provider adapter until Genblaze has a first-class
text asset body field. For text input you want the pipeline to screen, mirror the
exact text into `Asset.metadata["text"]`.

## Failure behavior

- Failed moderation sets `step.status=FAILED`, `error_code=INVALID_INPUT`
- `step.metadata["moderation"]` carries structured details: `stage`, `reason`, `flagged_categories`
- Moderation hook exceptions are caught and fail the step with `error_code=UNKNOWN`
- Works with `fail_fast=True` (stops pipeline) and `fail_fast=False` (continues)
- Steps with `prompt=None` skip pre-step moderation only when they have no textual input payload

## Async support

Override `acheck_prompt()` and `acheck_output()` for native async. Defaults wrap sync methods via `asyncio.to_thread()`.
