# Model registry decoupling

**Status:** draft V2 (post-red-team) · **Owner:** core · **Target release:**
`genblaze-core 0.3.0` · **Shape:** breaking — soft-launch, no backcompat shims
· **Feedback refs:** F-2026-05-04-01 (NVIDIA `riva-tts` 404) and the broader
catalog-rot class it represents (GMI April reconciliation, etc.).

> **Red-team status:** V1 was reviewed by an independent reviewer and produced
> 11 substantive issues, 3 classified "must fix before implementation
> starts." All are addressed inline in V2 — see "Red-team resolutions"
> appendix at the end.

## Problem

The SDK ships editorial content — hardcoded upstream model slugs — inside
library releases. Slug churn upstream (NVIDIA renames Riva → Magpie, GMI rolls
TTS variants, OpenAI deprecates DALL-E 2) creates rot whose half-life is
shorter than our release cadence. Today's symptoms:

- `genblaze_nvidia/models/audio.py` ships `nvidia/riva-tts` which now 404s
  from NIM. Permissive fallback masks it; the user sees a mid-pipeline
  `ProviderError(MODEL_ERROR, 404)`.
- GMI's April reconciliation found every audio default 404'd against the
  live `/requests` endpoint. The connector now flags `extras["suspected_dead"]`
  on entire model families as a stop-gap.
- Pricing tables (~50 references across 11 generative connectors) inherit
  the same rot one layer down: rates change without the SDK noticing.

These are not connector bugs. They're the consequence of conflating two
unrelated concerns inside one tuple:

1. **Slug list** — high rot, owned by upstream, churns between our releases.
2. **Param-shape rules** — low rot, real engineering value (SDXL needs
   `text_prompts` wrapping, FLUX takes `aspect_ratio`, GMI wraps in
   `{"payload": ...}`, NVIDIA video2world routes the video slot).

Slugs change; param contracts within a family don't. Today they live in the
same data structure, so curating one forces curating the other.

## Goal

Stop shipping slug lists. Keep param-shape rules, keyed by model family
(regex pattern), so the SDK's authority surface matches what it can
actually own truthfully. Slugs become user inputs and (where the upstream
exposes a catalog) discovery results — never SDK constants.

## Non-goals

- Network-on-import. Registry construction stays in-memory and synchronous.
- Pricing infrastructure expansion. We **phase out** SDK-shipped pricing.
  No companion `genblaze-pricing` package, no pattern-keyed pricing
  inheritance, no new pricing strategies. `register_pricing()` stays as the
  user-side contract for cost tracking. A one-shot cookbook
  (`docs/reference/pricing-recipes.md`) preserves the last-known prices
  as copy-paste recipes; it is **not** maintained going forward.
- Backcompat shims. genblaze is in soft launch; we make the clean break in
  0.3.0. Deprecation cycles are reserved for post-1.0.
- Probe-CI for connectors without discovery. We classify support honestly.

## Architecture

Five principles, refined post-red-team:

1. **The SDK owns shapes, not slugs.** Param contracts live as
   `ModelFamily` rules keyed by regex pattern. Slugs do not appear in
   `models/*.py` as defaults.
2. **Discovery is the upstream's job, with honest classification.**
   Connectors declare `DiscoverySupport ∈ {NATIVE, PARTIAL, NONE}`. The
   classification drives validation outcomes — a `PARTIAL` provider can
   never return `OK_AUTHORITATIVE` from family match alone (RT-1).
3. **Validation surfaces drift before the wire — but only as honestly as
   the provider can support.** Three outcomes: `OK_AUTHORITATIVE` (slug
   confirmed live by discovery or provider-supplied probe), `OK_PROVISIONAL`
   (matched a family pattern but liveness unverifiable), `NOT_FOUND` (slug
   absent from authoritative catalog). Pipeline preflight gates each
   independently.
4. **Family liveness probing is the PARTIAL escape hatch.** Families on
   `PARTIAL` providers may declare an optional `probe: FamilyProbe`
   callable that performs a cheap upstream liveness check (HEAD,
   empty-payload POST returning 400≠404). Probe results cache per-slug
   per-process, with TTL.
5. **Validation primitives collapse, not proliferate.** `validate_model()`
   subsumes `probe_model()`. The legacy `probe_model()` becomes a thin
   adapter that delegates to `validate_model(refresh=True)` and returns
   a coerced `ProbeResult` for the existing `tools/probe_models.py`
   consumers. Single source of truth for "is this slug usable" (RT-8).

### Modified core types

#### `model_registry.py`

`ModelRegistry` becomes:

- Constructor: `ModelRegistry(provider_families=(), fallback=FALLBACK_SPEC, *, strict_params=False, discovery_cache=None)`. The `defaults` mapping is **removed** in PR #13 (see RT-4 for migration shim shape).
- Two family layers (RT-3):
  - `_provider_families: tuple[ModelFamily, ...]` — frozen post-construction; from connector.
  - `_user_families: list[ModelFamily]` — RLock-guarded; user-registered, prepended (precedence).
- New methods:
  - `match_family(model_id) -> FamilyMatch | None` — checks `_user_families` first, then `_provider_families`. First-match-wins within each layer. Lock-free read of frozen tuple, RLock-guarded read of user list (snapshot copy).
  - `validate(model_id) -> ValidationResult` — non-network. Checks user registry → user families → provider families → discovery cache (no fetch) → fallback. Returns the strongest outcome each source can substantiate (RT-1).
  - `validate_with_discovery(model_id, *, refresh=False) -> ValidationResult` — issues discovery fetch and/or family probe as needed.
  - `register_family(family) -> None` — prepends to `_user_families` under RLock.
  - `families: tuple[ModelFamily, ...]` — public introspection (returns `tuple(_user_families) + _provider_families`).
  - `known()` — returns user-registered slugs ∪ examples from families ∪ last-discovered slugs. **Documentation-grade hint, not a contract.**
  - `__contains__(model_id)` — coherent with `validate()`: returns `True` iff `validate(model_id).outcome ∈ {OK_AUTHORITATIVE, OK_PROVISIONAL}`. `NOT_FOUND` and `UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE` both return `False` (RT-11d, refined in final review).
- `get(model_id)` precedence: user spec → user family → provider family (returns `spec_template` with `model_id` substituted) → discovery cache → fallback. Same `DeprecationWarning` mechanic for `deprecated_aliases` is preserved.
- **Family count cap (RT-9)**: `MAX_PROVIDER_FAMILIES = 32`. Constructor raises `ValueError` if the connector ships more. Forces connectors to keep the surface tight.

#### `base.py` (`BaseProvider`)

```python
class BaseProvider:
    discovery_support: ClassVar[DiscoverySupport]   # required class attribute

    def discover_models(self, *, max_age_seconds: float | None = None) -> DiscoveryResult:
        """Default: DiscoveryResult(status=UNSUPPORTED). Override on connectors
        with /v1/models or equivalent. The fetcher must forward auth (RT-11b)."""

    def validate_model(self, model_id: str, *, refresh: bool = False) -> ValidationResult:
        """Public entrypoint. Delegates to registry.

        | DiscoverySupport | family match? | family.probe? | refresh? | Outcome |

        | NATIVE           | yes              | n/a  | yes   | OK_AUTHORITATIVE if in catalog else NOT_FOUND |
        | NATIVE           | yes              | n/a  | no    | OK_AUTHORITATIVE if cached else issue fetch |
        | NATIVE           | no               | n/a  | yes   | NOT_FOUND if catalog fresh else UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE |

        | NONE             | no               | n/a  | n/a   | UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE |

        OK_PROVISIONAL is the honest outcome when the SDK matches a family
        pattern but cannot confirm liveness. Pipeline preflight emits a WARN
        for OK_PROVISIONAL; raises for NOT_FOUND.
        """

    @deprecated("Use validate_model(refresh=True). Removed in 0.4.0.")
    def probe_model(self, model_id: str) -> ProbeResult:
        """Adapter: delegates to validate_model(refresh=True) and coerces
        the ValidationResult to a ProbeResult for legacy probe-CI consumers.
        Kept for one minor only (RT-8)."""

`ValidationResult` so external probe-CI consumers don't break in-flight.

        }
        for fut, (i, ps) in futures.items():

            f"match any family; permissive fallback applies.",
        )
    # OK_AUTHORITATIVE: silent.
```

`Pipeline.preflight(False)` opts out for hot paths. **Test coverage: both
paths covered explicitly** (RT-11c).

#### `_errors.py` (every connector)

Each connector's error mapper enriches 404 responses with an actionable
message. Pattern:

```python
def _enriched_model_error(model_id: str, provider_name: str) -> str:
    return (
        f"{provider_name} returned 404 for model {model_id!r}.\n"
        f" - This slug may be retired upstream. Run "
        f"provider.validate_model({model_id!r}, refresh=True) for a "
        f"deterministic check, or provider.discover_models() to refresh.\n"
        f" - Migration: docs/migration/registry-decoupling.md"
    )
```

### Pricing phase-out (per non-goal, refined per RT-7)

This plan removes pricing tables as a side effect of the family migration.
**No new pricing infrastructure is added.** Per RT-7, the impact on
enterprise cost-tracking users is **non-trivial** and acknowledged
honestly:

1. **Day 0** — every connector ships pricing on its existing slug specs.
   `compute_cost()` works.
2. **Per-connector migration PR** — defaults → families. Pricing tables
   (`_RUNWAY_PRICING`, `_PRICE_PER_CHAR`, `_SFX_DURATION_BUCKETS`,
   `_IMAGEN_PER_IMAGE_RATES`, `_RATES`, `_VIDEO_PRICING`, `_COST_PER_SEC`,
   `_PRICE_PER_SEC`, `_IMAGE_PRICE`, `_LMNT_PRICE_PER_CHAR`) are deleted.
   New `spec_template`s ship `pricing=None`.
3. **Same-PR cookbook update** — every migration PR appends a section to
   `docs/reference/pricing-recipes.md` with the deleted constants in
   `register_pricing()` form. Users who relied on `compute_cost()` can
   copy-paste the recipe. The cookbook is timestamped, marked
   "last verified YYYY-MM-DD", and explicitly disclaimed: **"prices in
   this document are not maintained; verify with the upstream before
   relying on them."**
4. **End state** — zero hardcoded prices in the SDK code. `compute_cost()`
   returns `None` for any family-resolved model without user-registered
   pricing. Cost-tracking is a user opt-in via `register_pricing()`.
5. **Helpers retained** in `genblaze_core.providers.pricing`: `per_unit`,
   `by_param`, `bucketed_by_duration`, `per_input_chars`,
   `per_input_tokens`, `per_response_metric`, `bucketed_by_duration`,
   `by_model_and_param`. User-facing primitives. No removal, no addition.
6. **CHANGELOG** documents the pricing breaking change with a one-pipeline
   recipe in the 0.3.0 entry. `Pipeline.estimated_cost()` returning `None`
   is called out explicitly.
7. **Risks table updated**: pricing impact is reclassified to **Medium
   (enterprise users with cost-estimation flows are degraded until they
   migrate to register_pricing())** — see Risk #7.

### `extras["suspected_dead"]` (per RT-10)

The GMI `suspected_dead` flag is **not** removed at migration time — its
signal is preserved through the family layer:

- For families on PARTIAL providers, an optional
  `unstable_examples: tuple[str, ...]` field lists slugs known or
  suspected dead.
- `validate_model()` for any slug in `unstable_examples` returns
  `OK_PROVISIONAL` with `detail="known_unstable; verify with discover_models()"`.
- The flag is removed only after the family's `probe` callable is
  implemented and passing in CI for the relevant slugs — i.e., we replace
  the flag with a real liveness check, not just delete the signal.

### Migration shim (RT-4) — historical, removed in PR #13

PR #1 introduced `ModelRegistry` v2 with **both** `provider_families=()` and
a transitional `defaults={}` parameter so the per-connector PRs (#2-#12)
could land incrementally. PR #13 deleted the shim. The post-shim
lookup precedence is:

1. user spec
2. user family
3. provider family
4. discovery cache
5. fallback

The legacy dict shared the user-spec tier (`self._user.get() or self._defaults.get()`),
so removing it preserved exact-match semantics — every connector
migrated cleanly to `provider_families=` (or `fallback=` alone for
empty-catalog providers like LMNT / Replicate). Test fixtures that
previously built registries via `ModelRegistry(defaults={...})`
migrated to `reg.register(spec)` / `reg.extend(specs)`; the
`tests/unit/test_no_defaults_kwarg.py` conformance gate prevents
re-introduction.

| `decart` | ~~`_IMAGE_MODELS`, `_VIDEO_MODELS`~~ → families | ~~`per_unit`, `by_param`~~ → recipe | `NONE` (PR #7) | no |
| `elevenlabs` | ~~enumerated voices/sfx~~ → families | ~~`per_input_chars`, `bucketed`~~ → recipe | TTS = `NATIVE` (`client.models.get_all()`); SFX = `NONE` (PR #8) | n/a |
| `google` | ~~enumerated~~ → families (Veo `^veo-`, Imagen `^imagen-`) | ~~`per_unit`, per-second~~ → recipe | `PARTIAL` (PR #10 — `client.models.get` probe) | yes — `client.models.get(slug)` |
| `lmnt` | already empty + fallback | `per_input_chars` | `NONE` | no |
| `luma` | ~~enumerated~~ → families (`^ray-`) | `None` (recipe published) | `NONE` (revised from `PARTIAL` during PR #11 — lumaai SDK exposes no per-slug probe that doesn't enqueue a billable generation; small fixed catalog mirrors Runway / Decart precedent) | n/a |
| `openai` | ~~enumerated~~ → families (TTS, GPT-Image, DALL-E, Sora) | ~~`per_input_chars`, tiered, `None`~~ → recipe (Sora stays None — per-second formula) | `NATIVE` (PR #9) | n/a |
| `replicate` | already empty + fallback | `per_response_metric` | `NATIVE` | n/a |
| `runway` | enumerated | `by_model_and_param` | `NONE` (revised from `PARTIAL` during PR #6 — runwayml SDK doesn't expose raw HTTP for the empty-payload trick; small fixed catalog makes submit-time errors enough) | n/a |
| `stability-audio` | ~~single-model dict~~ → families (`^stable-audio-`) | ~~`per_second`~~ → recipe | `NONE` (PR #12) | no |
| `s3`, `langsmith` | n/a | n/a | n/a — exempt | n/a |

LMNT and Replicate already use the empty-catalog + fallback pattern; they
are **proof points** that this architecture works in production today
(LMNT) and at scale (Replicate handles thousands of upstream slugs via
`FALLBACK_SPEC` alone). They become the conformance test fixtures.

## Performance targets

Hard gates enforced by `tests/perf/test_registry_perf.py`:

| Operation | P99 budget | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Family pattern resolution (1 family) | < 5 µs | Compiled regex, single match |
| Family resolution (32 families, miss) | < 50 µs | Linear scan, all-miss case |
| Family resolution (adversarial input, 32 families) | **< 100 µs** | Pattern-safety guard rejects unsafe patterns at construction (RT-9); `re2` if available |
| Registry construction | < 10 ms | No I/O, no network |
| `validate_model()` (no fetch) | < 50 µs | Dict + family scan + cache read |
| Pipeline preflight (3 steps, mixed providers, NATIVE cached) | < 50 ms | ThreadPoolExecutor; single-flight discovery cache |
| Pipeline preflight (3 steps, cold) | < 800 ms | First fetch per provider via single-flight |
| Discovery fetch | < 500 ms typical | RetryPolicy w/ backoff on transient errors |
| Memory per registry | < 100 KB | Specs + compiled patterns + discovery cache |

Concurrency model:

- `_provider_families` is immutable post-construction (frozen `tuple`);
  resolution is lock-free.
- `_user_families` is RLock-guarded (RT-3); resolution snapshots the list
  under the lock and scans the snapshot.
- Discovery cache uses `threading.RLock` + single-flight `Event`. Concurrent
  callers from N threads share one fetch. RetryPolicy + Retry-After header
  respect for 429 responses (RT-11a).
- `register()` / `register_pricing()` / `register_family()` retain
  RLock-guarded writes.

Family count cap (`MAX_PROVIDER_FAMILIES = 32`) prevents future connector
authors from undermining the perf bound (RT-9).

## Observability

Structured log surface:

| Logger | Level | Event | Cardinality |
|---|---|---|---|
| `genblaze.registry.lookup` | DEBUG | per-resolution; fields: `model_id`, `source`, `family_name` | per call |
| `genblaze.registry.fallback` | INFO | dedup'd one-time per `(provider, slug)` | bounded |
| `genblaze.discovery.fetch` | INFO | per-discovery; fields: `provider`, `slug_count`, `latency_ms`, `source_url` | per fetch |
| `genblaze.discovery.failed` | WARN | per-failure; fields: `provider`, `reason`, `latency_ms`, `retry_count` | per failure |
| `genblaze.discovery.rate_limited` | WARN | when 429 hits the retry budget | bounded |
| `genblaze.preflight.provisional` | WARN | dedup'd one-time per `(provider, slug)` for `OK_PROVISIONAL` | bounded |
| `genblaze.preflight.unknown_slug` | WARN | dedup'd one-time per `(provider, slug)` for `UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE` | bounded |
| `genblaze.preflight.not_found` | ERROR | per failed preflight (raises) | per pipeline |
| `genblaze.family.probe` | DEBUG | per probe; fields: `provider`, `family_name`, `slug`, `result` | per probe |

OpenTelemetry: `tracer.span("registry.validate")`, `tracer.span("discovery.fetch")`,
`tracer.span("family.probe")` integrate with existing `NoOpTracer` /
`LoggingTracer` abstractions.

Metrics:
- `registry.lookup_total{source}` (counter)
- `registry.lookup_latency_seconds{source}` (histogram)
- `discovery.fetch_total{provider, status}` (counter)
- `discovery.fetch_latency_seconds{provider}` (histogram)
- `family.probe_total{provider, family, result}` (counter)
- `preflight.outcome_total{outcome}` (counter)

## Test strategy

### Unit (`libs/core/tests/unit/`)

- `test_model_family.py` — pattern matching, spec_template substitution,
  example_slug independence, regex compilation at module load,
  pattern-safety rejection.
- `test_pattern_safety.py` (RT-9) — assert known catastrophic-backtracking
  patterns raise; assert `re2` integration when available.
- `test_model_registry_v2.py` — precedence ordering across all six layers,
  user-family-prepend semantics (RT-3), `__contains__` coherence with
  `validate()` (RT-11d), single-flight discovery stress (50 concurrent
  threads → 1 fetch issued), TTL expiry (RT-6).
- `test_validation_outcomes.py` — every `(DiscoverySupport, family-match,
  probe, cache state, user registration, refresh)` combination produces
  the documented `ValidationResult`. Goldens for the full matrix
  (~3×3×3×2 = 54 cases).
- `test_pipeline_preflight.py` — `preflight=True` raises on `NOT_FOUND`,
  emits WARN on `OK_PROVISIONAL` and `UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE`, silent on
  `OK_AUTHORITATIVE`. **`preflight=False` skips the path entirely
  (RT-11c).**
- `test_pricing_phaseout.py` — lint-style guard: no `pricing=` argument
  in any `ModelFamily` `spec_template` literal, no `_PRICE_*` /
  `_*_PRICING` / `_RATES` constants in `libs/connectors/*/genblaze_*/`
  source files post-migration.

### Conformance (`libs/core/tests/conformance/test_provider_contract.py`)

Extend the existing parametric harness:

- Every entry-point provider declares `discovery_support: DiscoverySupport`.
- Every family in every provider has ≥ 1 `example_slug`, and every
  example matches its family's pattern (catches reviewer typos).
- For `discovery_support == NATIVE` providers with `GENBLAZE_PROBE_*_API_KEY`
  set: `discover_models()` returns `DiscoveryResult(status=OK)` with a
  non-empty slug set (RT-11b — auth forwarding).
- `validate_model("__definitely_not_a_real_slug_12345__")` returns:
  `UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE` for `NONE`, `NOT_FOUND` for `NATIVE` (with creds),
  `UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE` for `PARTIAL` without probe.
- No `models/*.py` file contains `pricing=` after migration (lint guard).
- For `discovery_support == NATIVE` providers, every `example_slug`
  matches a slug in the live discovery catalog **OR** is documented in
  `unstable_examples` (RT-5 — closes the example-slug rot vector for
  NATIVE providers).

### Performance (`libs/core/tests/perf/test_registry_perf.py` — NEW)

`pytest-benchmark` harness. Hard gates from the Performance section.
Includes adversarial-input benchmark: a corpus of slugs designed to
exercise pattern matching against every family. P99 must hold under
fuzz inputs (RT-9).

### Probe-CI (`tools/probe_models.py` — modified)

Two modes:
- `--mode pattern-coverage` (default): for each `NATIVE` provider,
  call `discover_models()`, assert every returned slug matches some
  family pattern OR is registered explicitly. Slugs without coverage
  reported as `family_drift` entries — **hard CI gate** (RT-5: `family_drift`
  for NATIVE providers breaks the build, not a soft signal).
- `--mode example-liveness` (NATIVE only): assert every `example_slug`
  is currently in upstream's discovery catalog. Hard CI gate. Closes
  the example-slug rot vector identified in RT-5.

The legacy "probe each `known()` slug" mode is removed — its premise
(curated `known()` list) no longer holds.

### Golden tests (`libs/core/tests/golden/test_resolution.py` — NEW)

Snapshot pattern resolution for a corpus of representative slugs across
all providers. Reviewer must include snapshot diff in any family pattern
edit. Catches accidental pattern widening or narrowing.

### Fuzz (`libs/core/tests/unit/test_family_fuzz.py` — NEW)

Hypothesis-based:
- generate random strings (length 0 to 100k, full Unicode);
- assert pattern resolution is deterministic, total (no exceptions);
- assert P99 < 100 µs on adversarial inputs (RT-9).

## Rollout sequencing

Soft launch — single 0.3.0 minor cuts the entire change. PRs are sequenced
to keep CI green at each merge. **Order matters**: core first, then proof-
points (LMNT, Replicate), then the active fire (NVIDIA), then the rest in
dependency-light order.

| # | PR | Contents | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `core: ModelFamily + ValidationResult + DiscoverySupport` | All new types, registry v2, pipeline preflight, conformance/perf/golden test scaffolding. Transitional `defaults=` parameter retained on `ModelRegistry` (code-path shim, RT-4). | `make test` passes; perf gates green |
| 2 | `lmnt: declare DiscoverySupport.NONE` | Already empty-catalog. Conformance test as proof-point. | LMNT package tests pass |
| 3 | `replicate: declare DiscoverySupport.NATIVE` | Already empty-catalog; wire `/v1/models` discovery. | Replicate tests + probe pattern-coverage |
| 4 | `nvidia: families for audio/video/image; chat discovery; family.probe for PARTIAL` | The active fire. NVIDIA chat = NATIVE; generative = PARTIAL **with `family.probe`** (empty-payload POST trick). riva-tts slug deleted; magpie-tts via family pattern. | NVIDIA tests; CHANGELOG entry |
| 5 | `gmicloud: families + family.probe + suspected_dead → unstable_examples` | RT-10: preserve dead-slug signal through family layer until probe-confirmed. | GMI tests + probe pattern-coverage |
| 6-7 | `runway`, `decart` | Mid-complexity catalogs with pricing. | Package tests + probe pattern-coverage |
| 8-10 | `elevenlabs`, `openai`, `google` | NATIVE discovery; pricing tables removed; recipes published. | Package tests + probe + cookbook published |
| 11-12 | `luma`, `stability-audio` | Smallest catalogs. | Package tests pass |
| 13 | ~~`core: remove transitional defaults= shim; finalize`~~ ✅ landed | Deleted the legacy dict path from `ModelRegistry` (constructor parameter, `_defaults` field, `validate()` shim branch, `fork()` merge). Migrated 38 unit-test sites to `register()` / `extend()`. Cleaned LMNT and Replicate of `defaults={}` calls. Added `tests/unit/test_no_defaults_kwarg.py` conformance gate. Bonus: relaxed `FamilyProbe` from kwarg-pinned Protocol to `Callable[..., LiveProbeResult]` so SDK-based probes typecheck. | Conformance + core suites green |
| 14 | ~~`docs: migration guide + pricing recipes + README rewrites`~~ ✅ landed | New `docs/guides/migrating-to-0.3.md` — TL;DR, before/after for 4 patterns, ValidationOutcome decision tree. `model-registry.md` reorganized so families lead. `provider-system.md` Cost Tracking → recipe pointer + new DiscoverySupport overview. `new-provider.md` rewritten with NATIVE / PARTIAL / NONE decision tree and `_fetch_models` / `_invoke_family_probe` examples. README + ARCHITECTURE cross-links. NVIDIA + GMICloud connector READMEs updated. All four `verify-docs` checks green; per-doc Python parse on 71 fenced blocks clean. | All `verify-docs` checks green |
| 15 | `samples: migrate downstream reference apps` | Update `backblaze-labs/genblaze-gmicloud-pipeline` and `backblaze-labs/nvidia-nemotron-genblaze-b2`: delete `_defaults` mutations, replace per-model registry workarounds with family-pattern equivalents (most workarounds dissolve), add `Pipeline(preflight=False)` opt-out only where UX requires. **Lives in those repos, not this one** — this row tracks coordination. | Sample apps' CI green against `genblaze-core 0.3.0` |

Total: **14 PRs in this repo + 1 coordination PR** for downstream samples.
Estimated duration: 3-4 weeks at one engineer's pace; 2 weeks if
parallelized across connectors after PR #1.

## Risks & mitigations (post-red-team)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pattern misses a new family member with surprising slug | Medium | Low | Permissive fallback + error enrichment + probe-CI `family_drift` hard gate for NATIVE |
| Discovery API changes upstream | Low-Medium | Low | `DiscoveryResult.FAILED` falls through to permissive; one WARN; no crash; RetryPolicy w/ backoff |
| Misconfigured pattern matches wrong slug | Low | Medium | Golden tests; reviewer must include snapshot diff |
| Catastrophic-backtracking regex DoS | Low | High | `pattern_safety.assert_safe` at `ModelFamily` construction; `re2` if available; fuzz tests with P99 bound (RT-9) |
| **Pricing removal degrades enterprise cost-estimation** | **High (expected)** | **Medium** (was Low) | Per-connector pricing-recipes cookbook published in same PR as the removal; CHANGELOG documents `Pipeline.estimated_cost()` returning `None`; user opt-in via `register_pricing()`. Honest documentation, not silent degradation (RT-7) |
| Pipeline preflight adds startup latency | Medium | Low | Single-flight discovery + ThreadPoolExecutor; `preflight=False` opt-out; perf gate enforces < 50 ms warm / < 800 ms cold |
| `validate_model` confused with `probe_model` | Low | Low | RT-8: `probe_model` deprecated and delegates to `validate_model`; removed in 0.4.0 |
| `discover_models()` requires auth per-provider, blocking CI | Medium | Low | `GENBLAZE_PROBE_*_API_KEY` env-var pattern; conformance test asserts auth forwarding (RT-11b) |
| Soft-launch users still pinning to deleted slugs | High | Low | 404 with enriched error message; migration guide; CHANGELOG entry |
| **PARTIAL providers' family-only OK is false precision** (was Issue 1) | High (resolved) | Resolved | RT-1: `OK_PROVISIONAL` outcome distinct from `OK_AUTHORITATIVE`; family.probe escape hatch; preflight emits WARN |
| **`asyncio.gather` in sync codebase** (was Issue 2) | High (resolved) | Resolved | RT-2: ThreadPoolExecutor on sync path; `asyncio.gather` only in `arun()` |
| **Migration shim masks bugs** (was Issue 4) | Medium (resolved) | Resolved | RT-4: code-path shim, not regex shim |
| Long-running daemon staleness | Medium | Medium | RT-6: default TTL 3600s; `_DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS = 3600.0` constant |
| Stale `example_slugs` ship as CI-enforced docs | Medium | Low | RT-5: `--mode example-liveness` hard gate for NATIVE; PARTIAL examples documented as advisory |
| `__contains__` / `known()` / `has()` incoherence | Low | Low | RT-11d: `__contains__` mirrors `validate().outcome != UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE` |
| `unstable_examples` deprecation forgotten | Medium | Low | Conformance test flags families with `unstable_examples` older than 6 months without a probe; nudges maintainers to either probe-confirm or delete |
| Downstream sample apps break on 0.3.0 | High (expected) | Medium | PR #15 coordinates `backblaze-labs/genblaze-gmicloud-pipeline` + `nvidia-nemotron-genblaze-b2` migration; net code-shrink (per-app workarounds dissolve into family patterns); `Pipeline(preflight=False)` is the conservative opt-out |

## Open design decisions (locked)

1. **Family ordering matters.** First-match-wins. Connectors must order
   families from most-specific to least-specific. Conformance test detects
   shadowed families via subset analysis.
2. **`example_slugs` semantics differ by `DiscoverySupport`.** For NATIVE
   providers, examples are CI-gated (must be live in upstream catalog).
   For PARTIAL/NONE, they're advisory and documented as such.
3. **Discovery TTL default = 3600s (1 hour).** RT-6: long-running daemons
   refresh on a sane cadence by default. `max_age_seconds=None` opt-in
   for CLI scripts that want one-fetch-per-process.
4. **Discovery is per-provider-instance.** Two `NvidiaProvider` instances
   with different API keys may see different catalogs; cache lives on the
   instance.
5. **Preflight default = ON.** Soft launch — loud failures.
6. **`_provider_families` is `tuple` (immutable post-construction);
   `_user_families` is RLock-guarded list with prepend semantics.** RT-3
   resolves the precedence question explicitly.
7. **No `families` inheritance across providers.** Each connector ships
   its own.
8. **Family count cap = 32 per provider.** RT-9: prevents perf-bound
   erosion as connectors grow.
9. **`probe_model()` deprecated in 0.3.0, removed in 0.4.0.** RT-8: single
   "is this slug usable" entrypoint going forward.
10. **`MAX_PROVIDER_FAMILIES = 32`** is enforced at registry construction
    via `ValueError`. Encourages connector authors to keep families tight.

## Acceptance criteria

This plan is complete when:

- [ ] Zero `_AUDIO_MODELS`, `_IMAGE_MODELS`, `_VIDEO_MODELS`, `_RATES`,
      `_PRICING`, `_PRICE_*`, `_*_BUCKETS`, `extras["suspected_dead"]`
      constants in any `libs/connectors/*/genblaze_*/` module.
- [ ] Every entry-point provider declares
      `discovery_support: DiscoverySupport`.
- [ ] Every family has ≥ 1 `example_slug`; each example matches its
      family pattern.
- [ ] `validate_model()` returns deterministic, documented results across
      the 54-case `(DiscoverySupport, family-match, probe, cache state,
      user registration, refresh)` matrix.
- [ ] `Pipeline.run()` raises `ProviderError(MODEL_ERROR)` at preflight
      for `NOT_FOUND`. **`Pipeline.preflight(False)` skips the path.**
- [ ] `compute_cost()` returns `None` for any family-resolved model with
      no user-registered pricing. Documented in CHANGELOG.
- [ ] `tools/probe_models.py --mode pattern-coverage` passes for every
      `NATIVE` provider against staging credentials. **Hard gate.**
- [ ] `tools/probe_models.py --mode example-liveness` passes for every
      `NATIVE` provider. **Hard gate.**
- [ ] Performance gates pass:
      - pattern resolution P99 < 5 µs (1 family) / < 50 µs (32 families) /
        < 100 µs (adversarial)
      - registry construction < 10 ms
      - preflight (3 steps, warm) < 50 ms; cold < 800 ms
- [ ] `pattern_safety.assert_safe` rejects all catastrophic-backtracking
      patterns in the test corpus.
- [ ] `docs/migration/registry-decoupling.md` published.
- [ ] `docs/reference/pricing-recipes.md` published with one section per
      migrated connector.
- [ ] `docs/reference/model-matrix.md` regenerated from families.
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry under 0.3.0 with migration recipes for the 5 most
      common callsite patterns + pricing migration.
- [ ] One example in `examples/` migrated end-to-end demonstrating
      `validate_model()` preflight.

## Resolves the reporter's complaint

Mapping back to F-2026-05-04-01 (NVIDIA `riva-tts` 404):

| Reporter ask | Plan resolution |
|---|---|
| Replace dead `nvidia/riva-tts` slug | Slug deleted entirely. NVIDIA audio family pattern covers Magpie/Riva/Fugatto-shaped slugs. **`family.probe` (empty-payload POST trick) provides liveness check on PARTIAL** — RT-1. |
| Validate the rest of `_AUDIO_MODELS` | n/a — list deleted. Family pattern + probe covers the surface; probe-CI catches drift. |
| Surface deprecation warning before pipeline runs | `Pipeline.run()` issues `family.probe` for every PARTIAL-provider step at preflight. `NOT_FOUND` raises before any generation begins. `OK_PROVISIONAL` (no probe configured) emits WARN. |
| CHANGELOG entry for slug change | One CHANGELOG entry under 0.3.0 documenting the catalog-decoupling, including riva-tts disposition. Going forward: no slug-rename CHANGELOG entries (no slugs pinned). |

## Out of scope (explicitly)

- Provider-side rate limiting and retry policy unification — owned by
  `retry-policy-unification.md` (we *use* `RetryPolicy` here, do not
  redefine it).
- Cost-ledger replay — owned by `pipeline-replay-and-cost-ledger-tranche.md`.
- Manifest signing — owned by `manifest-signing-and-redaction-tranche.md`.
- Re-introducing pricing infrastructure of any kind. Phase-out is one-way;
  `register_pricing()` is the user contract.

## Red-team resolutions appendix

V1 was reviewed by an independent reviewer; this V2 closes all 11 issues:

| RT# | Issue | V2 resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PARTIAL providers still produce mid-pipeline 404s — family-match returned `OK` with no liveness signal | New `OK_PROVISIONAL` outcome distinct from `OK_AUTHORITATIVE`; `FamilyProbe` callable on PARTIAL families; preflight raises on probe `DEAD` |
| 2 | `asyncio.gather` in sync codebase crashes FastAPI/Jupyter | `ThreadPoolExecutor` on sync `Pipeline.run()`; `asyncio.gather` only in `AsyncPipeline.arun()` |
| 3 | `register_family` precedence ambiguity, TOCTOU on tuple rebuild | Two layers: `_user_families` (RLock list, prepend) and `_provider_families` (frozen tuple). Lookup is user-first |
| 4 | PR #1 shim could mask all preflight bugs during 12-PR window | Shim is **code-path** (legacy `defaults=` dict path inside registry), not a regex pattern. Cannot mask `NOT_FOUND` for unmigrated connectors |
| 5 | `example_slugs` are CI-enforced (must match pattern) yet "non-binding" — rot vector preserved | NATIVE: `--mode example-liveness` hard CI gate against live catalog. PARTIAL/NONE: examples are advisory, documented as such |
| 6 | Discovery TTL `None` default → long-running daemons silently stale | Default TTL = 3600s (1 hour). `max_age_seconds=None` is opt-in for one-fetch-per-process |
| 7 | Pricing phase-out misclassified as "Low" impact for enterprise users | Reclassified to **Medium**. Same-PR pricing-recipes cookbook with copy-paste `register_pricing()` recipes; CHANGELOG explicit on `Pipeline.estimated_cost()` returning `None` |
| 8 | `validate_model` vs `probe_model` — three overlapping entry points | Collapsed: `probe_model` deprecated, delegates to `validate_model(refresh=True)` returning coerced `ProbeResult`. Removed in 0.4.0 |
| 9 | Performance gates unanchored to realistic conditions; regex DoS vector | `MAX_PROVIDER_FAMILIES=32` cap; `pattern_safety.assert_safe` at `ModelFamily` construction; `re2` if available; fuzz P99 < 100 µs on adversarial inputs |
| 10 | `extras["suspected_dead"]` removed without replacement signal for PARTIAL | New `unstable_examples: tuple[str, ...]` on `ModelFamily`; preserved through migration; removed only after `family.probe` is implemented and CI-passing |
| 11a | Discovery rate limit handling absent | RetryPolicy with exponential backoff + jitter, capped at 3 retries; Retry-After respected; rate-limited responses logged at WARN |
| 11b | Discovery auth forwarding contract undocumented | Conformance test asserts NATIVE providers' fetcher returns `OK` against staging credentials |
| 11c | `preflight=False` path untested | Explicit unit test in `test_pipeline_preflight.py` |
| 11d | `__contains__` / `known()` / `has()` incoherence | `__contains__` mirrors `validate().outcome != UNKNOWN_PERMISSIVE` |
