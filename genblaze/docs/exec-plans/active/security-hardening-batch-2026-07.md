# Security hardening batch — ffmpeg escaping/redaction, hash-depth guard, SSRF completeness, ReDoS guard

Tracks six independently-scoped security issues fixed together because they touch
overlapping modules (`libs/core/genblaze_core/providers/`, `_utils.py`,
`canonical/`). One commit per issue; this doc is the shared plan.

## Issues and fixes

### #17 — ffmpeg drawtext `%` expansion / control-sequence escaping
`_escape_drawtext` (`providers/transform.py`) escapes `\`, `:`, `'` but not `%`,
which ffmpeg's drawtext filter treats as a text-expansion trigger
(`%{expr:...}`, `%{pts}`, etc. — enabled by default). Fix: escape `%` → `%%`
(ffmpeg's own literal-percent escape), which also fully neutralizes `%{...}`
since the brace becomes plain text once expansion is disabled for that
occurrence. Literal `\n`/`\t` (two-char sequences typed by a caller) are
already neutralized by the existing backslash-doubling — added a regression
test to make that explicit instead of just asserting it in prose.

**Found in review (P0, fixed in the same commit):** the pre-existing quote
escaping (`'` → `\'`) was itself broken. ffmpeg's quoted values have no
backslash-escape mechanism of their own — a naive `\'` still ends the quoted
string early, so a `;` immediately after an embedded quote becomes live
filtergraph syntax (e.g. `text='x\';scale='` splices in an attacker-named
`scale` filter). Reproduced against real ffmpeg 7.0.1
(`Error applying option 'fontsize' to filter 'scale'`). Fixed by using
ffmpeg's own documented mechanism: close the quote, add a backslash-escaped
quote outside it, reopen a new quote (`'` → `'\''`) — re-verified the same
attack payload now succeeds cleanly.

### #75 — presigned URL leaked in ffmpeg DEBUG log
`run_ffmpeg` (`providers/_ffmpeg_utils.py`) logs `" ".join(cmd)` verbatim at
DEBUG. A chained step's `https://` input can be a presigned object-storage URL
whose query string is a bearer credential until expiry. Fix: redact the query
string of any `http(s)` argument before logging (execution still uses the
untouched `cmd`).

**Found in review (P1, fixed in the same commit):** a second leak path —
ffmpeg's own stderr can echo the input URL verbatim on a fetch failure (e.g.
an expired-signature 403), and that stderr became the `ProviderError` message
logged on step failure. Added `_redact_urls_in_text()` (regex-based, for
free-form text where the URL isn't a standalone token) and apply it to
`stderr` before truncation, so a signature straddling the 500-char cutoff
can't leak its surviving half either.

### #81 — `RecursionError` on deeply nested `step.params`
`canonical/_normalize.py:normalize()` recurses with no depth cap; `step.params`
is free-form user input hashed into every manifest and cache key. Fix: thread
an optional `_depth` counter through `normalize()` and raise `ManifestError`
past a 100-level cap — well under Python's default recursion limit, so the
failure is a controlled, typed error instead of a stack overflow. No change to
sort order, float rounding, or any other normalization behavior (kwarg is
additive with a default, so all existing call sites are unaffected).

### #16 — SSRF denylist misses IPv4-mapped / NAT64 / unspecified forms
`resolve_ssrf` in `_utils.py` already normalizes `::ffff:0:0/96`-mapped IPv6
(fixed under #9/PR #112) but not RFC 6052 NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`, a different
prefix `ipaddress.IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped` doesn't recognize) or the
unspecified address `::/128`. Fix: extract the embedded IPv4 address from the
NAT64 well-known prefix the same way mapped addresses are unwrapped, add
`::/128` to `BLOCKED_NETWORKS`, and add a property-based backstop
(`is_private`/`is_loopback`/`is_link_local`/`is_reserved`/`is_unspecified`) so
ranges neither list enumerates are still caught. A Hypothesis property test
asserts the mapped/NAT64 representation of any generated IPv4 address has the
same blocked/allowed status as the plain address — the actual bypass class
this issue describes.

### #80 — ReDoS heuristic bypasses + re2 path never active + missing perf gate
Three separate root causes, all closed:

1. **Wrong import.** `pattern_safety.py` did `import google.re2 as _re2`, but
   the current `google-re2` PyPI distribution ships a top-level `re2` module
   (`import re2`), not a `google.re2` namespace package. The authoritative
   check has therefore never run for anyone, regardless of whether
   `google-re2` was installed — this is the real reason "re2 is never active"
   described in the issue, not just a missing dependency. Fixed the import.
2. **Heuristic bypasses.** Added `{n,}` (open-ended brace quantifier,
   semantically identical to `+`) to the unbounded-quantifier detection, added
   an adjacent-same-atom-quantifier check (`a+a+a+`), and replaced the
   nesting-blind `[^)]*` group scan with a small paren-depth-aware scanner so
   `([a-z]+(?:x)?)+`-shaped patterns (unbounded quantifier nested inside a
   sub-group, not directly inside the outer group's flat text) are caught.
3. **Missing perf gate.** Added `libs/core/tests/perf/test_registry_perf.py`
   backing the docstring's "P99 < 100µs on adversarial input" claim, using
   min-of-N timing (stable under CI scheduler noise; percentile-of-samples on
   a shared runner is not) as the practical implementation of that claim.

**Found in review (P1, fixed in the same commit):** a fourth heuristic
bypass — 2+ *adjacent* parenthesized groups, each individually carrying an
unbounded quantifier (`(a+)(a+)(a+)`), with no outer quantifier at all. This
is a distinct shape from `(a+)+`: the ambiguity comes from every possible
split point between the groups being a valid match, which is combinatorial
in the group count rather than requiring an outer repeat. Confirmed
empirically (6 adjacent `([a-z]+)` groups: ~10.4s to match a 100-character
adversarial string under stdlib `re`). Neither `_has_nested_unbounded_quantifier`
(no group is itself followed by a quantifier) nor `_ADJACENT_QUANTIFIED_ATOM`
(a parenthesized group isn't a single regex-matchable "atom") caught it.
Added `_has_adjacent_unbounded_groups()`, reusing a new shared
`_iter_group_spans()` helper (factored out of the nested-quantifier scanner
for DRY) to find top-level groups and flag 2+ adjacent ones that are each
unbounded. Verified against the real connector pattern set: no false
positives.

Additionally: added `google-re2` as a new `re2` optional extra (guarded
import, same pattern as the existing `otel`/`http` extras) and included it in
`dev`, so CI's `libs/core[dev]` install actually activates the authoritative
path going forward. Verified all 32 shipped connector family patterns compile
under re2 and none trip the strengthened heuristic (no false positives).

**Deferred:** a CI job that installs a deliberately-bad pattern and asserts
the *build* fails end-to-end (as opposed to the unit test suite exercising
`assert_safe` directly, which is in scope and included) — tracked in
tech-debt-tracker as a follow-up; the existing test suite already gates on
every commit via `assert_safe` running at `ModelFamily` construction time in
every connector's test collection, so the practical protection is in place
even without a dedicated CI job.

### #18 — `.gitignore` only covers `credentials.json`
Broadened to `credentials*` plus `*.credentials`, `*_rsa`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`,
`*.keystore` per the issue's suggested fix. Preventative; no tracked secret
files existed before or after.

## Pre-push triangulated review

Three independent reviewers examined the full branch diff before push, each
with no knowledge of the others' findings:

- **Correctness/issue-coverage** — no blocking findings; all six issues
  confirmed genuinely fixed with root-cause remediation and non-tautological
  regression tests.
- **Engineering quality** (DRY, architectural fit, doc-claim accuracy) — no
  blocking findings; confirmed no duplication, no dead code, doc/CHANGELOG
  claims match the code, and `assert_safe` still runs only at
  `ModelFamily` construction time (not a hot path).
- **Adversarial security** — found the #17 quote-escaping P0 and the #75/#80
  P1s documented above by actively trying to defeat each fix (with real
  ffmpeg and real timing measurements, not just static reading). All three
  were fixed and re-verified in place before push; no reviewer found any
  other bypass across all six issues.

## Cross-batch note

A parallel batch is adding tests around `canonical_hash` normalization (#50).
The #81 fix here is additive (new optional kwarg, default preserves existing
behavior) and touches only `_normalize.py` — kept deliberately minimal to
avoid conflicts.
