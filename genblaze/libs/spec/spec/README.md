# genblaze-spec

Language-neutral contract for genblaze manifests and streaming events.

Ships:

- **`schemas/manifest/v1/`** — Draft 2020-12 JSON Schemas for the
  `Run` / `Step` / `Asset` / `Manifest` / `EmbedPolicy` wire format.
  These are the authoritative wire contract — stricter than what
  Pydantic's `model_json_schema()` auto-generates (closed objects,
  uuid/uri formats, sha256 patterns, required fields that reflect
  serialization behavior rather than input validity).
- **`schemas/events/v1/`** — Draft 2020-12 JSON Schemas for the
  `StreamEvent` discriminated union emitted by `Pipeline.stream()` /
  `Pipeline.astream()` and the agent loop. One file per variant
  (`pipeline.started`, `step.failed`, `agent.iteration.evaluated`, …)
  plus a parent `stream-event.schema.json` with `oneOf` + `discriminator`.
  In-process Python objects (`step`, `result`) are deliberately absent
  from the wire contract — derived `step_status` / `manifest_hash` /
  `run_status` / `error` fields carry the equivalent information.
- **`ts/genblaze.d.ts`** — TypeScript type declarations generated from
  the schemas. Drop this into a frontend/Node project and import the
  types directly. Includes the `StreamEvent` discriminated union so
  `if (ev.type === "step.failed") { ev.error }` narrows correctly.

## Why

Consumers that parse or render manifests from TypeScript were
hand-writing interfaces against the Python Pydantic models and drifting
— inventing fields that don't exist (`b2_key`, `videoRun`) and omitting
fields that do (`asset_id`, `metadata`, `width`/`height`/`video`/`audio`).
The schemas + generated types eliminate that drift by making the
contract a single source of truth that both languages consume. The
`events/v1/` schemas extend the same pattern to runtime streaming —
dashboards, SSE relays, and webhook backends stop hand-rolling
`StreamEvent` shapes and branch on the discriminator with precise
per-variant narrowing.

## Consuming the TypeScript types (phase 1a)

Until `@genblaze/spec` is published to npm (phase 1b), consume via git:

```bash
# option 1: vendor the file
curl -o src/types/genblaze.d.ts \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backblaze-labs/genblaze/main/libs/spec/ts/genblaze.d.ts

# option 2: git submodule (keeps updates easy)
git submodule add https://github.com/backblaze-labs/genblaze vendor/genblaze
```

Then:

```ts
import type { Manifest, Run, Step, Asset, EmbedPolicy } from "./types/genblaze";

function render(m: Manifest) {
  for (const step of m.run.steps) {
    // step.step_id, step.status, step.assets — all typed
  }
}
```

Types follow the serialized JSON shape exactly: `run.run_id` (not `.id`),
`step.step_id` (not `.id`), `asset.url` (no separate `b2_key` —
`url` is the durable handle).

For streaming consumers (SSE, WebSocket), the same file exports
`StreamEvent` plus one interface per variant. Discrimination on `type`
narrows to the right variant automatically:

```ts
import type { StreamEvent } from "./types/genblaze";

function handle(ev: StreamEvent) {
  if (ev.type === "step.failed") {
    // ev.error, ev.step_id, ev.elapsed_sec — all typed
  } else if (ev.type === "pipeline.completed") {
    // ev.manifest_hash, ev.run_status — all typed
  }
}
```

## Regenerating

```bash
make ts-types
```

This runs `libs/spec/scripts/generate-types.sh`, which invokes a pinned
`json-schema-to-typescript` via `npx` and writes `ts/genblaze.d.ts`.
The script is deterministic — rerunning with no schema changes produces
a byte-identical file.

## Drift prevention

Two guardrails stop schemas, Pydantic models, and generated types from
drifting apart:

1. **`libs/core/tests/unit/test_spec_conformance.py`** — asserts
   bidirectional field-set equality, matching enum values, closed
   `additionalProperties`, and that every field carries a description.
   Runs under `make test`.
2. **CI `ts-types` job** — regenerates the `.d.ts` and fails if the
   committed file would change. Any schema edit that doesn't also
   update `ts/genblaze.d.ts` is rejected at PR review.

## Versioning

Schema versioning tracks `Manifest.schema_version`. The published JSON Schema
and generated TypeScript type are capped at `1.5` while the Python reader rolls
out `1.6` URL-only hash-marker read support. Non-Python producers must not emit
`1.6` until a later write-enabled release updates these schemas.
Once published to npm (phase 1b), `@genblaze/spec` versions will move
lockstep with `genblaze-core` — a `genblaze-core@0.3.0` release
publishes `@genblaze/spec@0.3.0`, even if only Python changed. This
keeps "which types match my SDK?" answerable with a single version
number.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1a (current)** — committed `.d.ts`, drift guards, consumed via git
- **Phase 1b** — publish `@genblaze/spec` to npm with provenance and
  dual ESM/CJS; ship raw schemas alongside types for runtime validation
  via `ajv`
- **Phase 2 (on demand)** — `@genblaze/spec/zod` subpath for ergonomic
  runtime validation with inferred types
- **Phase 3 (on demand)** — `@genblaze/manifest` with pure-TS canonical
  JSON + SHA-256, enabling client-side `canonical_hash` verification
  without a backend round-trip

See `docs/exec-plans/active/ts-type-codegen.md` for full rationale.
